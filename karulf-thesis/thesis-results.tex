\chapter{User Study}

In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed user interface, we employed  a series of user studies 

\section{Testing Procedures}

\section{Results}
In our post-experiment questionnaire, sever users remarked that the keyboard and mouse bindings in the supervisor interface were counter-intuitive. They felt that moving the camera should be done with the keys or the keyboard, and rotating the camera should be a function of a mouse click and drag event.
