\section{Results}
\label{sec:study-results}
In this section, I will present the results of the user study. The subjective ratings in the pre-experiment and post-experiment questionnaires were measured using a 7-point Likert scale. The majority of our analysis was run results of running between-participants analysis of variance (ANOVA) using completion time, total neglect time, or total idle time as dependent variables. All times are presented in seconds.


We define a successful interface as one that minimizes task completion time (TC), task idle time (IT), or neglect time e (NT). All times are given in seconds.
